Sunshine
========

Sunshine is a Simple weather forecast app that brings the forecast for 5 days to 4 different cities (London, Paris, SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) for every 3 hours.

The app name was inspired in the app created for the Udacity course Developing Android Apps. Although the name is the same, only the original initial project (HelloWorld) was used from the repo.

All the development diverges from the one proposed in the course. For the original project, please refer to https://github.com/udacity/Sunshine

This app uses the public API from Open Weather Map (https://openweathermap.org/). The API documentation can be found here: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5

This code is continuosly being upgraded for study purposes. Suggestions for different architectures and bugfixes are welcome.
